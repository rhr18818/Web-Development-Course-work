## Pascal’s Triangle Generator

This JavaScript function generates the first `numRows` of Pascal’s Triangle.

```js
/**
 * @param {number} numRows
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var generate = function(numRows) {
    const res = [[1]];

    for (let i = 0; i < numRows - 1; i++) {
        const dummyRow = [0, ...res[res.length - 1], 0];
        const row = [];

        for (let j = 0; j < dummyRow.length - 1; j++) {
            row.push(dummyRow[j] + dummyRow[j + 1]);
        }

        res.push(row);
    }

    return res;
};
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Function Signature and Initial State**

   * Defines `generate(numRows)` which returns a 2D array of Pascal’s Triangle up to `numRows`.
   * Initializes `res` with the first row: `[[1]]`.

   *Analogy*: Think of `res` as a stack of pancakes; you start with one pancake on the plate.

2. **Outer Loop**

   ```js
   for (let i = 0; i < numRows - 1; i++) { … }
   ```

   * We already have one row. To reach `numRows`, we perform `numRows – 1` iterations to build the remaining rows.

   *Analogy*: If you need 5 pancakes but already have 1, you only need to make 4 more.

3. **Padding with Zeros and the Spread Operator**

   ```js
   const dummyRow = [0, ...res[res.length - 1], 0];
   ```

   * **`res[res.length - 1]`**: grabs the most recent row (an inner array).
   * **Spread operator `...`**: unpacks each element of that inner array into the new array literal.
   * Wrapping with `[0, …, 0]` adds zeros at both ends.

   *Result*: If the last row is `[1, 2, 1]`, `dummyRow` becomes `[0, 1, 2, 1, 0]`.

**Reason for adding zeros:** Adding `0` at both ends guarantees that when we sum adjacent pairs, the edge cases automatically produce `1` (since `0 + firstElement = 1` and `lastElement + 0 = 1`), so there’s no need for special logic to handle the first and last elements.

4. **Summing Adjacent Pairs**

   ```js
   const row = [];
   for (let j = 0; j < dummyRow.length - 1; j++) {
       row.push(dummyRow[j] + dummyRow[j + 1]);
   }
   ```

   * Slides a window of size 2 along `dummyRow`.
   * Sums each adjacent pair and appends it to `row`.

   *Example*: On `[0, 1, 2, 1, 0]`, you get `1, 3, 3, 1` → new row.

5. **Appending New Row**

   ```js
   res.push(row);
   ```

   * Adds the newly computed row to `res`.

6. **Return Result**

   ```js
   return res;
   ```

   * Returns the final 2D array containing all rows of Pascal’s Triangle up to `numRows`.

### Why the Spread Operator?

* **Syntax**: `...[iterable]`
* **Purpose**: Unpacks elements of an iterable into a new array.
* **In Context**: We have a 2D array `res` (an array of rows). The spread only unpacks one dimension—the inner row array—so we can reconstruct it with added zeros.

**Concrete Walk-through**
Given:

```js
res = [[1], [1,1], [1,2,1]];
```

1. `res.length - 1` → `2`; `res[2]` → `[1,2,1]`
2. `[0, ...[1,2,1], 0]` → `[0,1,2,1,0]`
3. Summing adjacent pairs:

   * `0+1=1`, `1+2=3`, `2+1=3`, `1+0=1`
     yields the next row `[1,3,3,1]`.

This padding trick ensures that even the edges sum correctly to `1` without special-casing them.

### Why It’s Not About 2D vs. 1D Per Se

* **2D array**: `res` holds multiple rows, each of which is a 1D array.
* **Spread operator scope**: When you write `...[res[res.length - 1]]`, you’re only spreading (unpacking) that single inner array, not the entire 2D structure.
* **Clarification**: You cannot use `...[res]` to flatten two dimensions; the spread works one level deep. Here, we intentionally grab only the last row (a 1D array) and spread its elements.

**Real-world analogy**: If `res` is like a bookshelf (rows) holding books (elements), the spread pulls out one book at a time from a chosen shelf, not the entire library. By choosing that shelf (the last row) and spreading it, we can insert blank books (zeros) at each end before summing neighbors.
