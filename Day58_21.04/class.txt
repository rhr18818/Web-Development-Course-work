More on  --- OOP 
In --Js everything is Object -- so everything has prototype !!

1. an prototype shared memmory space don't create new memmory each time of Object creation 
2. For that -- whenever need to make a Object where value will be duplicated
then use prototype -- which will not create a new memmory space !!
